# chatbot
Following a youtube tutorial, I developed a simple chatbot, that can learn and save the answers we give him. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkkjXTER2KE&amp;t=653s)
The knowledge_base.json file, is where the answers and questions are stored and retrieved from.
The main is where all the functions are defined.
